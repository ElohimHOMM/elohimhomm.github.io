Visit my Github Profile [here](https://github.com/ElohimHOMM)

## List of working Projects

### General Projects
- [Latex Utils](latex-utils)
    - I don't even think this works as it should
- [The Elohim Tree](the-elohim-tree)
    - Attempt at an Idle-Game
    - Very much paused
- [WynnHERO](WynnHERO) 
    - Specification of my Discord Bot accessing the Wynncraft API
- [train-project](train-project) 
    - Honestly I didn't know what this project would be, turns out it's just AOC again, but in JS this time with a nifty little UI.
    - I'm probably not going to be working on it too much, but it is a fun little thing to do while I'm peddling for 5 hours.

### One Off Projects Made For Specific People or something like that

- [howabouthamburg](howabouthamburg) 
    - Made to ask someone out on a date.

### NSFW Projects

- [Rule34 API Accesser](https://crungolo.github.io/rule34-randomizer/)
    - I made this under an alias, I will probably move it to my space at some point..., Also I realized there's smarter ways to call the API, so there's some updates that need to be done there.
- [Kinklist with more options and legacy content](kinklist) 
    - It was due to be improved, come on.

## List of non working projects

### Non-Working Links with future plans
- [Elohim AOC](elohim-aoc)
    - CURRENTLY NOT WORKING
    - Again, I want this to eventually be a UI for AOC with explanations
- [Fulgens](fulgens)
    - CURRENTLY NOT WORKING
    - Again, I want this to be a specification of my Admin Discord Bot eventually.
    - This one is also due for a fucking rename at some point

## Abandonware

### Project Graveyard (abandoned projects)
Honestly why am I not just deleting these? Probably fond memories or something like that.
