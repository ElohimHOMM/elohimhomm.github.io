### NSFW Projects

- [Rule34 API Accesser](https://crungolo.github.io/rule34-randomizer/)
    - I made this under an alias, I will probably move it to my space at some point..., Also I realized there's smarter ways to call the API, so there's some updates that need to be done there.

    - It was due to be improved, come on.
